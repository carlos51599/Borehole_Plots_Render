# MAP INTERACTION AND DRAWING TOOLS - FIXES APPLIED

## âœ… **ISSUES FIXED**

### 1. **Map Keeps Re-centering Issue**
- **Problem**: Map center input caused callback to trigger on every pan/zoom
- **Fix**: Removed `Input("borehole-map", "center")` and `Input("borehole-map", "zoom")` from callback
- **Result**: Map only centers once after file upload, then stays where user pans

### 2. **Auto-zoom Not Working** 
- **Problem**: Map centered but didn't zoom in appropriately
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `Output("borehole-map", "zoom")` to callback outputs
  - Added intelligent zoom calculation based on coordinate spread
  - Zoom levels: 8 (very spread) â†’ 11 (regional) â†’ 14 (local) â†’ 16 (close together)

### 3. **Drawing Tools Not Working**
- **Problem**: Used `Input("draw-control", "n_clicks")` which doesn't trigger on drawing
- **Fix**: Changed to `Input("draw-control", "geojson")` which triggers when shapes are drawn
- **Result**: Drawing tools now respond immediately when shapes are completed

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL CHANGES**

### **Callback Structure Updates**:
```python
# BEFORE (problematic)
Input("draw-control", "n_clicks")        # Wrong trigger
Input("borehole-map", "center")         # Caused re-centering loop  
Input("borehole-map", "zoom")           # Caused re-centering loop

# AFTER (fixed)
Input("draw-control", "geojson")         # Correct trigger for drawing
Output("borehole-map", "zoom")          # Added zoom control
# Removed map center/zoom inputs to prevent loops
```

### **Auto-zoom Logic**:
```python
# Calculate zoom based on coordinate spread
lat_range = max(lats) - min(lats)
lon_range = max(lons) - min(lons) 
max_range = max(lat_range, lon_range)

if max_range > 1.0:     map_zoom = 8   # Very spread out
elif max_range > 0.1:   map_zoom = 11  # Regional spread  
elif max_range > 0.01:  map_zoom = 14  # Local area
else:                   map_zoom = 16  # Very close together
```

## ðŸ§ª **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW**

1. **Upload AGS files** â†’ Markers appear, map auto-centers and zooms once
2. **Pan/zoom map** â†’ Map stays where you put it (no more re-centering)
3. **Draw shapes** â†’ Section plots generate immediately when shape is completed
4. **Debug output** â†’ Shows center coordinates and zoom level

## ðŸŽ¯ **TEST INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Run `python app.py`
2. Upload AGS files â†’ Map should auto-zoom to markers once
3. Pan around â†’ Map should stay where you pan it
4. Use drawing tools â†’ Draw a polygon/rectangle around some markers
5. **Expected**: Section plot should appear immediately after completing the shape

The app should now provide smooth interaction without constant re-centering and responsive drawing tools!
