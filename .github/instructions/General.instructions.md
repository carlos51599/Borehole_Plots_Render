Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

**Very Important**

Feedback Automation Guideline:

After completing any task, ALWAYS request interactive feedback through the MCP (interactive-feedback-mcp) before ending your session or reply. Do not pause or wait for user confirmation before proceeding to the feedback stepâ€”automatically request feedback as the final action for every task.

Additionally, if during your work you decide to make a significant change or deletion that could have wider implications for the project, you MUST also call the interactive feedback MCP at that decision point. This ensures that all major decisions are reviewed and validated interactively before proceeding further.

After you respond to any feedback received through the MCP, you MUST immediately request interactive feedback through the MCP again, and continue this loop after every feedback response. Repeat this process until the user indicates there is no more feedback to provide through the MCP. Only then may you end your session or reply.


**Documentation**
Use mcp Context7 when searching for documentation

**Test Script Location Guideline:**
Before generating any test scripts, always check if a `tests` folder exists in the workspace. If it does, save all new test scripts in that folder.

**Report Location Guideline:**
Before generating any .md files, always check if a `reports` folder exists in the workspace. If it does, save all new report files in that folder.

**Logging Location Guideline:**
Before generating any log files, always check if a `logs` folder exists in the workspace. If it does, save all new log files in that folder.

**Important:** Never attempt to create or manage Python environments (e.g., virtualenv, conda, venv) in any model or automation. Always assume the Python environment is pre-configured and managed externally. Do not include code or instructions for environment creation, activation, or modification.

**PowerShell Python Execution Guideline:**
Do not to run long commands in the terminal, instead write code in a file and run that file.
