INTEGRATION COMPLETE - File Upload + Drawing Tools Fixed
========================================================

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added EditControl back to the app.py layout within a separate FeatureGroup
2. Re-enabled draw-control inputs and states in the main callback
3. Restored drawing functionality in the callback logic
4. Used separate FeatureGroups for markers and drawing tools to avoid conflicts

KEY FIXES:
- EditControl is now in its own FeatureGroup ("draw-feature-group") separate from borehole markers
- All drawing-related inputs/states are re-enabled
- Drawing logic processes shapes and creates section plots
- File upload continues to work as before

LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
Map
├── TileLayer
├── FeatureGroup (id="borehole-markers") - for uploaded AGS file markers
└── FeatureGroup (id="draw-feature-group") - for EditControl drawing tools
    └── EditControl (id="draw-control")

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Run: python app.py
2. Open: http://127.0.0.1:8050
3. Upload AGS files - should see markers appear
4. Use drawing tools - should see polygon/rectangle/polyline tools
5. Draw a shape around markers - should generate section plot

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- File upload works and displays borehole markers
- Drawing tools are visible and functional
- Drawing shapes around markers creates section plots
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Both features work together without conflicts

The key was separating the EditControl into its own FeatureGroup to avoid the 
"options.featureGroup must be a L.FeatureGroup" error that occurred when trying 
to put EditControl in the same FeatureGroup as the markers.
