# DRAWING TOOLS FIX - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

### 🐛 **The Problem**
The drawing tool triggered correctly, but **no plots were generated** because:

1. **Scope Issue**: Drawing logic was nested inside the file upload condition
2. **Data Access**: `loca_df` and `filename_map` were only available during active uploads  
3. **Callback Structure**: Drawing operations couldn't access processed borehole data

### 🔧 **The Solution**

#### **1. Added Persistent Data Storage**
```python
# New dcc.Store component to persist borehole data
dcc.Store(id="borehole-data-store")

# Store processed data after file upload
borehole_data_out = {
    "loca_df": loca_df.to_dict(),  # Convert DataFrame to dict for JSON storage
    "filename_map": filename_map,
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
}
```

#### **2. Restructured Callback Logic**
```python
# NEW: Handle drawing operations FIRST (independent of uploads)
if drawn_geojson and drawn_geojson.get("features") and stored_borehole_data:
    # Reconstruct data from storage
    loca_df = pd.DataFrame(stored_borehole_data["loca_df"])
    filename_map = stored_borehole_data["filename_map"]
    
    # Process drawing and create plots
    filtered_loca_ids = filter_selection_by_shape(loca_df, drawn_geojson)
    # ... generate section plot ...
    
    # Return early with results
    return (outputs...)

# THEN: Handle file uploads (if any)
if stored_data and "contents" in stored_data:
    # ... upload logic ...
```

#### **3. Fixed Callback Inputs/Outputs**
- **Added**: `Output("borehole-data-store", "data")` 
- **Added**: `State("borehole-data-store", "data")`
- **Updated**: All return statements to include borehole data

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now**

1. **Upload AGS files** → Data stored + markers appear + auto-zoom
2. **Draw shapes** → Section plots generate **immediately** using stored data
3. **Multiple drawings** → Each new shape creates new section plot
4. **No re-upload needed** → Drawing works with existing data

## 📋 **Technical Details**

### **Data Flow**:
```
Upload → Process → Store Data → Display Markers
              ↓
Drawing → Access Stored Data → Filter Boreholes → Generate Plot
```

### **Callback Structure**:
```python
@app.callback([...outputs + borehole-data-store], 
              [...inputs], 
              [...states + borehole-data-store])
def callback(..., stored_borehole_data):
    # 1. Check for drawing operations FIRST
    # 2. Handle uploads SECOND  
    # 3. Return appropriate data
```

## 🚀 **Ready to Test**

1. Run `python app.py`
2. Upload AGS files → Markers appear
3. **Draw polygon around markers** → Section plot should appear **instantly**
4. **Draw another shape** → New section plot should replace the previous one

The drawing tool should now work exactly as expected, generating section plots immediately upon completing drawn shapes!
